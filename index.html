<h1>Understanding Hemoglobins</h1>
<h2>Structure & Function</h2>

<p>
  A <b>hemoglobin</b> is a polar globular polypeptide with a quaternary structure found in red blood cells, responsible for transporting oxygen 
  throughout the body and removing carbon dioxide from organs and tissues.
  It comprises four polypeptide chains <i>(see Figure a)</i>, each containing 141 or 146 different types of amino acids bound in a specific 
  sequence by peptide bonds, which form as a result of condensation reactions that release a water molecule.
